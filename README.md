# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.) 

    1.   Error Handling(Functionality, Both Claude and self): As a user, I want to have robust error message when encountering error so that I can receive a clear instruction when processing invalid data. 

    2. Escuated quote(Functionality, Self): As a user, I want to have the ability to use escuated quote in my CSV file so that I can include special characters(like quotation marked) in my data without breaking the CSV fomat.

    3. Newlines(Functionality, Self): As a user, I want to have the ability to use newlines in my CSV file so that I can include multi-line text in my data, like long paragraph and stories. Thus, we need a more comprehensive parser that do more then just line-by-line reading approach.

    4. Whitespace(Functionality, Claude): As a user, I want to have the ability to use whitespace in my CSV file so that I can include spaces and tabs in my data, like indented text and aligned columns while maintaining the data fomate of the CSV specification
   
    5. Data Type Conversion (Extensibility, New): As a user, I want the parser to automatically convert values to appropriate data types (numbers, dates, booleans) so that I don't have to manually convert strings after parsing.GPT also suggested adding support for data type conversion, which I do agree with.

Did not use coplite this time because I signed up github education pack late and whenever I try to use it, a message "Oops, your response got filtered. Vote down if you think this shouldn't have happened." pop up.
